//1. PREPARATORY PHASE AND APPENDING DIFFERERENT VERSIONS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE 
//Author Janina Jochim 
//Do-File Name: 
//Purpose: Import of APQ data from Excel into Stata per each v1,v2,v3 and then appended afterwards 
//Dataset Used: 
//Last edited: 26/2/2019 

//Method for preparing Excel to be imported
//Downloaded each of the three raw ODK files (v1,v2,v3), each saved in an individual Excel workbook. Transpose the data into a new tab so that the variable names are all in column A  
//Sheets then cleaned of notes or fieldlist names by filtering for note (called: generated_note_name) or fieldlist name (called: reserved_name_for_field_list_labels)  rows and manually deleting 
//Unnecessary prefix xbg_ etc removed by using text to columns (seperated by colon) and concatenate function to get all variables in same column
//Each sheet can then be retransposed, again into a new tab. At the end, each spreadsheet should have three tabs. 

//The following variables had to be reformatted to display 00:00:00 as dd/mm/yyyy: DateHBT3; C1DobHBT3; C2DobHBT3; C3DobHBT3
// As a last step, it is important to note that STATA cannot read alphanumerical information (i.e., child Serial numbers which have been recorded as, for instance, SN200a): 
//Initially, Serial numbers have been allocated to parents (e.g., SN200) and children (e.g., SN200a, SN200b, and SN200c) where SN200a is the oldest child and SN200c is the youngest 
//In the final spreadsheet, letters need to be converted into numbers in the following way: Parent ID: SN2000; Child A: SN2001; Child B: SN2002; Child C: SN2003 using the "Find and Replace" function 
//Special attention must be paid to unnessesary spaces in the participant ID and must be removed manually via visual scanning.

//3.2. Defining value labels
//In the steps below, first the labels are defined before they are attached to their respective variables. 
//For example, the variable HIV_Status can have three answer options "Giraffe", "Elephant", or "Bear" - each of these will be coded with a number in the questionnaire 
//and we need to record which number is attached to which options (e.g., 0 = Bear; 1 = Giraffe; 2 = Elephant). 
//Label values were created with an excel spreadsheet using the files for ODK programming 
//In the same spreadsheet that was previously used to compare the variables across versions, each variable was concatenated with the respective value 
//Remember, variables that have changed their name across different versions have previously been re-named with the last available version (e.g., in this 
//dataset this was the case for breastfeeding and babyfeeding) so the 'old' variables do not have to be labelled (because they don't exist anymore).
